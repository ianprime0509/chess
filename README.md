# Chess

This is supposed to be a collection of implementations of the same program in
different languages, for trying out or learning various languages. The program
is a basic 2-player chess game (no AI) to be played in a simple terminal
interface, with moves given in algebraic notation. The program is intended to
be simple enough to serve as a modest introduction to the language, but complex
enough to actually get into some of its details.
